                <h2>High Effort Podcast Assessment</h2>
                <p>Meng and I each conducted four user interviews, and we discovered that podcast listeners rarely discover new podcasts in the streaming apps. When users tried, they left disappointed and feeling like they spent a lot of effort assessing new podcasts without successfully finding one they enjoyed. We identified two key issues with the podcast discovery experience that make it hard to sift through podcasts.</p>

                <p>Recommendation algorithms match podcast topics well but need to catch up on matching tones.

                <p>The most straightforward tone indicators are the pills at the bottom of the text that highlight the podcast style.
