                <h2>High Effort Podcast Assessment</h2>
                <p>Meng and I each conducted four user interviews, and we discovered that podcast listeners rarely discover new podcasts in the streaming apps. When users tried, they left disappointed and feeling like they spent a lot of effort assessing new podcasts without successfully finding one they enjoyed. We identified two key issues with the podcast discovery experience that make it hard to sift through podcasts.</p>

                <h2>Assessing Tone is Hard</h2>
                <p>Recommendation algorithms match podcast topics well but need to catch up on matching tones.

                    <p>Looking at the current landscape, podcast streaming platforms only offer two ways to assess podcast tone: through listening to a snippet or reading a transcript, both of which are time-consuming. </p>

                <h2>Multi-pronged Tone Analysis Approach</h2>
                <p>The most straightforward tone indicators are the pills at the bottom of the text that highlight the podcast style. The card background will generate a visualization that abstractly represents the podcast tone. Lastly, we kept the sound bite, as it remains one of the best ways a listener can sample the podcast. </p>

                    <p>During our user interviews, we identified key factors listeners use to assess new podcasts that could be improved in the podcast discovery experience: topic, tone, content, and reviews.</p>
                    <p>Using card-sorting, I determined which factors are most helpful in assessing a new podcast and which to prioritize. We learned users are especially curious to learn why the podcast is being recommended, so we added it to our list of assessment factors. </p>
