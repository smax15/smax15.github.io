                <h2>Redesign a dashboard to enable remote cancer drug trials</h2>
                <p>During normal telehealth visits, a physicianâ€™s ability to assess a patient is limited by the format of teleconferencing. 
                    To make better use of the telehealth visits, I updated a previous dashboard that displays remote monitoring data (from wearables and surveys) with additional vital signs to enable a physician to assess a assess a patient remotely.

                <h4>Challenges</h4>
                <h2>An Opportunity to Reconnect with Users</h2>
                <p> At the start, I gathered feedback about previous dashboard iterations from the main user groups: study coordinators and physicians. The different user groups have different levels of influence within their workplace, which forced me to adapt my approach to communicate with the groups accordingly.

                    <p>Through the feedback sessions, the coordinators revealed they were using the previous dashboard to aggregate data for reports, which is an unintended use. They were endlessly frustrated that they could view data from the start of the trial or the current week. This drove my decision to increase data accessibility as a main focus of the redesign.

                    <p>Most of the painpoints from the original dashboard were related to constraints on accessing data and controlling tracking dates. 3 major opportunities for improvements were:</p>

                <p>Most of the time, the study coordinators will be using the dashboard to monitor the patients' compliance; the overview focuses on identifing days with missing data. Then, for report compiling, the detailed view gives access to data values.</p>

                <h2>The Doctor-Designer</h2>
                <p> At the start, the physician for this study had a unwavering vision for the dashboard in his head. I wireframed his design as a starting point to visualize the telehealth dashboard. 
                    The wireframe illustrated that the original vision's requirements caused the adverse events table to be unreadable.

                <h2>Focus on Primary Assessments</h2>
                <p>Further discussions revealed that the key information needed to assess vital signs were if they deviated from baseline so graphs were removed and alerts were used for measurements that needed attention. As a result adverse events has more real estate for create a readable table.

                <h2>Gently Push and Pull</h2>
                <p>In a hospital, the workplace hierarchy shapes behavior and certain voices are overshadowed or amplified. I learned two important lessons to get the most out of getting feedback from different stakeholders.
