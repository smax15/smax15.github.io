 		<p>This board game is independently created in 2022 after a night of multiple instances of mistaking roommates returning home and food deliverers as people breaking in. After the third "intruder" the creator's adreneline prevented her from falling back asleep and instead she dreamt up a board game that paid homage to the fateful night and her apartment in Venice Beach.</p>
 		<p>
 		Intruders! is a high action game, conversational game where you work in teams, chase down each other, and go head to head against your opponents. To win, you need the right combination of strategy, teamwork, and luck. This game is designed to be fast, exciting, and flexible as it can accomodate as little as 3 to as many as 10 players.
