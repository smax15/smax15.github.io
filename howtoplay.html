    <p><h3>Selecting Characters</h3>
    	Put the following in the role deck: 
    	<ul>
			<li>1 burglar</li>
			<li>Any remaining Foe according to the above chart</li>
			<li>Residents as according to the chart above</li>
			<li>Friends according to the chart above</li>
		</ul>
<p>Shuffle the role deck and pass out the roles to the players. Residents reveal their role,pick their characters, and get their players reference mats accordingly. Intruders do not get to pick their characters and cannot reveal whether they are a friend or a foe. All intruders begin with a generic intruder player reference mat. Once revealed, they swap out for their respective player reference mat.</p>
	<h4>Residents</h4>
<p>Residents will be on of the following characters:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tyler</li>
	<li>Alan</li>
	<li>Renee</li>
	<li>Sadie</li>
	<li>Topher</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Intruders</h4>
	<p>Intruders begin with a generic skill set and need to hold onto their role card. They are to act according to their game goals. Once an intruder’s identity is revealed, they must begin using their assigned role card for their skill sets. Intruders may reveal whether they are friend or foe by the following actions:</p>
	<ul>
<li>A player in the same room may confront the intruder by doing an awareness roll and if they roll 2 or higher then they may reveal the intruder’s identity. If the player fails to confront, they must end their turn immediately. If the player in turn is an unidentified intruder, they must reveal their identity. </li>
<li>A player in the same room may do a blind attack. During the attack, the identity is revealed and the intruder uses their assigned character card for their strength roll. If the intruder loses and is a friend, they must lose a skill point of their choosing. </li>
<li>The intruder may choose to attack anyone else. They must use the generic strength to do their strength roll. Their identity is revealed after the attack. </li>
<li>When an intruder walks into a room with the light on, their identity is revealed. </li>
</ul>
<p>When the intruder is revealed, they transfer their skill increases and decreases they earned from their previous gameplay as a generic intruder. 
For example, if they have +1 speed and -2 strength from their starting position before they were revealed, then they would apply the same to their revealed character.
