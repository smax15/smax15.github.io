                <p>As a part of a design challenge, Meng and I only had 4 weeks to complete the entire project from prompt to presentation. With our short time frame in mind, we outlined milestones for each phase of our projects. Inevitably, our design process wasn't linear but we were always able to move forward with each conversation.

                            Our mentor helped us reframe when we got stuck by reminding us of the bigger picture. I learned to refer back to a Northstar to guide our decisions when the team is stuck.

                            Coming to each mentor meeting with clear objectives, questions to ask, and a concise summary of each week's progress allowed us to make the most of our mentor's time.
